About Me
Hey there! I'm David, an self taught developer and engineer, and technology enthusiast. When I'm not coding, I'm busy raising my kiddos. I'm passionate about technology, and I'm always eager to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field.
My Coding Journey
My adventure in programming began when I came across python years ago. It took time for me to evolve into someone who can appreciate what you can really do with code. Since then, I've become proficient in various languages, including Python, JavaScript, and C++. I've worked on a diverse range of projects, from web applications to machine learning algorithms. You can check out my work on my GitHub Repositories page.
I've created up my own infrastructure at home for testing purposes, which includes creating custom pipelines with tools like Git and Ansible server for deployment to my homelab. I've also established a MariaDB where Ive populated 35k collected entries to practice query optimization and learn about cyber security and CI/CD processes. Additionally, I'm
