# whois

First and foremost, I am dad to triplet boys, who gave me the opportunity to become something great; as well as someone who has the potential, drive, and the ability that is required to make a future for myself and my children. 

> *Several* *of traits that are self-taught outside of IT are, portrait photography, and woodworking. In both instances I used my ability to focus as well as resources from internet, to learn the skills necessary to make a grind for myself.*
> 
> 
> *I’ve now had several small business ventures as well as work full time as a cabinetmaker at T&T Caseworks. I was sought out and offered a job, having never stepped in a cabinet-shop before; where I quickly established myself as a highly effective employee, by challenging myself and tirelessly aiming for quality.* 
> 

Looking to shift my career path into IT,  I believe that the amalgam of my experiences are best suited for that of a risk assessment, although open to other position opportunities. I am currently studying for the *CompTIA Security+* & *Juniper (JNCIA)* certifications.

# Skills, framework, and method.

- A curious and creative, critical thinker. Excellent  solving skills, and a goal oriented learner.  Have an understanding of security methodologies and big picture ideas.
- An an excellent learner, in that I absorb any knowledge that I can manage to be exposed to. My next step in life is to proceed in finding a job that will help me grow my knowledge and meet other likeminded people.
- Great with Linux command line, and understand how the Linux filesystems are structured.
- Top notch communication skills; patience, empathy, and understanding. Self-aware and capable of challenging own my beliefs (mental flexibility).
- I know the basics of coding languages, come to know some: BASH, Python, C++, HTML/CSS, JS, JSON, as well as how to format things like YAML and Dockerfile.
- Cloud Security roles  and least privileges; AWS IAM - API authentication, VLAN/VPC networking and predominately linode for private use.

## Social Engineer:

observing and analyzing social behavior; 10+ exciting years of social engineering,  rapport building, and risk assessment experiences. 

I found it necessary to go out and find the information in order to learn the things I am interested in.

# Creating Practical Experience for myself build target and replicate environments to hack.

- **Implementing attacks using *ESP32 microcontrollers* at home, to build target and replicate environments to hack.**
    - ***Example Setting:** 1 host device, and 2 or more clients (host programmed to have a WPA2/hidden network & clients communicate with each other).*
    - ***Example Attack:** Preforming a beacon attack to retrieve the hosts hidden SSID.  Using the gathered information to spoof/intercept handshakes from the client devices and crack the hash to gain the credentials needed to access the host from the threat device.*
        - ***Result:*** *Access has been gained to the network; from here ARP or DNS spoofing can be implemented to direct traffic and phishing can begin.*
        
- **Building Labs in “the cloud”**
    
    Using *Linode Cloud Computing* (and other *SaaS*) for building and securing my domains and servers behind services like *Cloudflare*. 
    
    - Allows me to practice penetration testing from the comfort of any browser that I have access too.
    - Spinning up *Linux servers* to learn *backend* and teach myself how to create and manage *VMs*.
    - Using *Docker Container’s* to host entire networks all on one server and practicing my attacks.
        - *Portainer, Kasm, Kali Linux, Parrot OS, Metasploitable, WordPress, Tor, etc…*
        
- ***Reverse Engineering* IoT hardware to learn about *UART*, *serial connections* and *data streams.***
    - Currently learning about onboard memory and recovering firmware from everyday devices with the goal obtaining root privileges.
    
- **OSINT and Recon**
    - Google dork and scraping APIs with tools like Maltego.
    - I’ve had several successful OSINT searches and found information on targets (gov salaries, police records, and property searches) for friends and family members.
    - Ran home network through vulnerability scans using tools like NMAP and Metasploit and patched the problems that I found.
    
- **Familiar with *Cross-Site Scripting* (XSS) and web application attacking.**
    - Successfully “hooked” browsers by copying trusted HTML pages and injecting *BeEf’s* JavaScript webhook.
    - Stress tested and exploited my own domains and servers through BurpSuite.
    
- **WI-FI Data Collection**
    - WI-FI is so open air, it’s important to be precise when throwing out attacks, the Wi-Fi Pineapple is great for that, makes EvilTwinPortals super easy and AP enumeration is incredibly easy with its GUI.
    - Built a Pwnagotchi from a Raspberry Pi, great for generating WI-FI hashes.
    - Built a WarDriving rig from an ESP8266 and a GPS module designed for a drone.
        - Allows me to plot Wi-Fi signals with its GPS coordinates. Great for collecting the data needed in order to overlay WI-FI targets on a map (using Python).
        
- **Home lab (Home network)**
    - Flashed my home router with *open source  firmware* ( OpenWRT)
    - Setup multiple *VLANs* which are categorized by device.
    - Followed the rule of least privilege.
    - Hardened *default passwords* and hostnames.
    - Adjusted *wireless signal power* to prevent outside connections.
    - *Synology NAS* server running docker to host things like Minecraft servers, and hosting other in house hosting.
    - Assembled *Windows Active Directory* and *Domain Controller*.
- Setup an environment in a as VMs, using *Windows Server 2019* as *domain controller* and *Windows 11* clients.
